The results on conditioned open-ended language generation are impressive, e.g. [GPT2 on unicorns](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#samples), [XLNet](https://medium.com/@amanrusia/xlnet-speaks-comparison-to-gpt-2-ea1a4e9ba39e), [Controlled language with CTRL](https://blog.einstein.ai/introducing-a-conditional-transformer-language-model-for-controllable-generation/). Besides the improved transformer architecture and massive unsupervised training data, **better decoding methods** have also played an important role. \n","\n","This blog post gives a brief overview of different decoding strategies and more importantly shows how *you* can implement them with very little effort using the popular `transformers` library! \n","\n","All of the following functionalities can be used for **auto-regressive** language generation ([here](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/) a refresher). In short, *auto-regressive* language generation is based on the assumption that the probability distribution of a word sequence can be decomposed into the product of conditional next word distributions: \n","$$ P(w_{1:T} | W_0 ) = \\prod_{t=1}^T P(w_{t} | w_{1: t-1}, W_0) \\text{ ,with }  w_{1: 0} = \\emptyset, $$\n","\n","and $W_0$ being the initial *context* word sequence. The length $T$ of the word sequence is usually determined *on-the-fly* and corresponds to the timestep $t=T$ the EOS token is generated from $P(w_{t} | w_{1: t-1}, W_{0})$.\n","\n","\n","Auto-regressive language generation is now available for `GPT2`, `XLNet`, `OpenAi-GPT`, `CTRL`, `TransfoXL`, `XLM`, `Bart`, `T5` in both PyTorch and Tensorflow >= 2.0!\n","\n","We will give a tour of the currently most prominent decoding methods, mainly *Greedy search*, *Beam search*, *Top-K sampling* and *Top-p sampling*.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Si4GyYhOQMzi"},"source":["Let's quickly install transformers and load the model. ~~We will use GPT2 in Tensorflow 2.1 for demonstration, but

(2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02492), it looks as *top-K* and *top-p* sampling also suffer from generating repetitive word sequences.\n","\n","In [Welleck et al.
